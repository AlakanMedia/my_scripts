# My scripts
In this repository I keep some scripts that I use in my operating system, these scripts are made in bash, but some have a version made in C.

## Scripts information
I have scripts to get the system brightness and volume, take screenshots, open the images folder, change the keyboard layout and one that is a powermenu. To know which dependencies each script has, it is recommended to open it and see which programs it calls in order to work, A large part of this depends on the program called [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).
